          My name is Eric Ji, and I am a fourth year Neuroscience major with a minor in Computer Science and Business. Ever since my first
          computer science courses in high school, I realized how rewarding it was to solve software problems. My love for software engineering only grew
          as I took intersesting courses in college, such as web programming and game development. From these classes, I found my passion for creating specific purpose application software.
          From creating games to solving specific algorithms, I realized that I had a knack for creating software that would solve specific problems rather than open ended tasks. This was one of
          the main reasons I applied to Lob; its focus on creating specific APIs to simplify direct mail and address verification aligns with my goals of improving my software engineering skills.
          I hope to learn more from Lob about how I can create more efficient code to solve specific company issues.

        <dt><a href="https://fall-2020.cs.utexas.edu/cs329e-bulko/ej6638/">Web Programming Projects</a></dt>
        <dd>This website has links to each of my assignments that I completed during my Web Programming course. Almost every link on this website, besides Final Project Phase 6, was individually done by me. The assignments I completed during this course mostly covered dynamic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and cookies. We also touched upon some SQL, AJAX, and JQuery concepts, and I am currently taking Elements of Databases to further my SQL knowledge. </dd>
        <dt><a href="https://fall-2020.cs.utexas.edu/cs329e-bulko/ej6638/Project1-6/index.html">My Video Game List</a></dt>
        <dd> This was my final project for my Web Programming course, where me and two other teammates made a fully functional website. The website's name is My Video Game List, which is a database that keeps reviews and ratings on games from several different consoles. Not only does it serve as a database for previous reviews and ratings, but it also allows users to create an account and leave their own reviews and ratings. It also has an interactive tier list maker that was primarily created from JavaScript. My role during this project was primarily developing HTML, JavaScript, and CSS functionality for our home, console, and log in/sign up pages. I spent the most time developing our console page to load images in JavaScript from metacritic, using python to format the image URLs into figure tags which are stored in a text file.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://cooperfryar.itch.io/space-raiders">Space Raiders</a></dt>
        <dd>This was a game I developed with two other teammates called Space Raiders, which plays similar to Space Invaders. It is a browser game that uses Phaser3, a HTML5 game framework. Most of the files for this game are JavaScript files, but use the syntax from the Phaser3 framework. I took on multiple roles for this project, including developing the mechanics and creating character models and maps with assets found online. The game includes interchangeable scenes, which are different levels in the game, and mechanics like power ups, player and enemy movement, and shooting. </dd>
