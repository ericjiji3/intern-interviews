      <p> Hello! I have been learning about computers since I was a young boy because my dad and two uncles are software
        engineers. They taught me many things about computers and inspired me to become a software engineer. I find that
        writing programs and figuring out why something doesn’t work is interesting for me. In my free time, I work on
        improving my coding skills.
      </p>
      <p> During my internship at Lob, I want to learn more about working in a company alongside experienced software
        engineers and learn more about web development. Most of my prior experience was either solo or in a small team,
        while all my web development skills were acquired by trial and error. There is a lot of room for improvement in
        my coding skills.
      </p>
      <p> Oh, and you may be wondering why there is a FedEx truck above. This fall, my dad and I couldn’t work for about
        a month because our employment documents got lost. If the company that assisted us with the documents used Lob,
        they would have realized the loss much earlier and we would stay out of trouble. That is why I’m very passionate
        about your technology and want to contribute to its development.
